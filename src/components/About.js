      <p className="paragraph about__copy">Walter offers more than paltry banter and potty humor. Walter is comedian and minstrel, educator and mystic, sailor with the soul of a Beat poet. With insightful eloquence, Walter speaks personally on topics ranging from Race and Religion to Gender and Sex to Gentrification and Homelessness. Walter's performance transcends modern comedy's vaudevillian origins, breaking the viewer/spectacle barrier and evoking in the audience a crisis of identity and introspection.</p>
